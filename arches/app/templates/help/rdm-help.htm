In Arches, controlled vocabularies consist of Concepts, and these Concepts are managed in Thesauri and Collections. In the RDM you can create new Thesauri, create new Concepts, import Concepts from external endpoint (like the Getty AAT), and ultimately, create Collections of Concepts, which will be passed to your app as data input dropdown lists." %}</p>

                <p>{% blocktrans %}A Concept is a qualitative property that can be attached to a resource, something like "Stone" (which may describe a building material) or "House" (which may describe a past use for a structure). The advantage of storing these properties as Concepts, is that a Concept may have attributes of its own. In the case of "House", we could add an AltLabel to that Concept of "Dwelling". That way, if a user searches for "dwelling", any resource with the "House" Concept attached to it will be found.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                <p>{% blocktrans %}Concepts can be nested as well, to allow more complex and meaningful relationships between them.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
